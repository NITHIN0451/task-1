    <b><big>HTML Introduction</big></b>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <b>HTML</b> stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>.
        It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.
        <li>HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it annotates
            text to define how it is structured and displayed by web browsers.</li>
        <li>It forms the building blocks of all websites and is complemented by CSS
            for style and JavaScript for interactivity.</li>
        In a nutshell, HTML is all about <b>organizing and displaying information</b> on a webpage.
        We can think of it as the <b>bones</b> or <b>structure</b> of a webpage.

    <h2 id="one">Why Learn HTML?</h2>
    Here are <b>5 common reasons to learn HTML</b>:
    <p><b>1.Build Websites</b>: HTML is the basic building block for creating any website. Learning HTML can help you
        pursue a career in web development.</p>
    <p><b>2.Customize Content</b>: Allows you to edit or tweak web pages, emails, or templates to fit your needs.</p>
    <p><b>3.Understand how the web works</b>: Helps you grasp how the internet works and how web pages are structured.
    </p>
    <p><b>4.Employment Opportunities</b>: According to Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment for web
        developers will grow 16% between 2022-2032, which is much faster than the average across all occupations.</p>
    <p> <b>5.Learn Easily</b>: HTML is beginner-friendly, making it a great first step into the world of coding and
        technology
    </p>
    <h2 id="two">Features of HTML</h2>
    <li>It is easy to learn and easy to use.</li>
    <li>It is platform-independent.</li>
    <li>Images, videos, and audio can be added to a web page.</li>
    <li>Hypertext can be added to the text.</li>
    <li>It is a markup language.</li>
    <h2 id="three">HTML Element and HTML Tag</h2>
    <p>HTML Element and HTML Tags are related but distinct. <b>An HTML element</b> is the complete structure, including
        the opening tag, content (if any), and the closing tag (if applicable).</p>
    <p>On the other hand, A <b>Tag</b> is the actual keyword or name enclosed in angle brackets (<>) that tells the
            browser what kind of content to expect.</p>

    <h2 id="four">HTML Page Structure</h2>
    <p>The basic structure of an HTML page is shown below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e.
        doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.</p>
    <img src="./sc3.png" width="500">
    <li>&ltDOCTYPE html &gt– This is the document type declaration, not a tag. It declares that the document is an HTML5
        document.
    <li>&lthtml&gt – This is called the HTML root element. All other elements are contained within it.</li>
    <li>&lthead&gt – The head tag contains the “behind the scenes” elements for a webpage. Elements within the head
        aren’t visible on the front end of a webpage. Typical elements inside the &lthead&gt include:</li>
    <li>&lttitle&gt: Defines the title displayed on the browser tab.</li>
    <li>&ltmeta&gtProvides information like the character set or viewport settings.</li>
    <li>&lt Links&gt external stylesheets or resources.</li>
    <li>&ltstyle&gtEmbeds internal CSS styles.</li>
    <li>&ltscript&gtEmbeds JavaScript for functionality.
    </li>
    <li>&lttitle&gt– The title is what is displayed on the top of your browser when you visit a website and contains the
        title of the webpage that you are viewing.</li>
    <li>&lth2&gt – The &lth2&gt tag is a second-level heading tag.</li>
    <li>&ltp&gt– The &ltp&gt tag represents a paragraph of text.</li>
    <li>&ltbody&gt – The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body
        content is what the browser will show on the front end.</li>
    <p>An HTML document can be created using an <b><big><u>HTML text editor</u></big></b> . Save the text file using the
        <b>“.html”</b> or <b>“.htm”</b> extension. Once saved as an HTML document, the file can be opened as a webpage
        in the browser.</li>
    </p>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0">
        <td><b><big>Note:</big></b>Basic/built-in text editors are <big><b>Notepad (Windows)</b></big> and TextEdit
            (MacOS). Other advanced text editors include <big><b>Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, Froala,</b></big>
            etc.</td>
    </table>
    <h2 id="five">Web Browsers</h2>
    <p>Unlike other programming languages, HTML does not show output on the compiler.<a
            href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-browser-a-complete-overview/" target="_blank">Web browsers</a> the
        results of an HTML code.</p>
    <p>It reads HTML files and determines how to show content with the help of HTML tags. Any web browser
        <b><big>(Google, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, etc)</big></b> can be used to open a . <b><big>HTML file</big></b> and
        view the results.

    <h2 id="six">HTML History</h2>
    <p>Currently, we are using <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html5-introduction/" target="_blank">HTML5</a>,
        which is the latest and most advanced version of HTML.</p>
    <P>HTML was initially created by <big><b>Tim Berners-Lee</b></big> in 1991 as a way to share and structure documents
        on the web.</P>
    <P>The first-ever version was <big><b>HTML 1.0,</b></big> a basic and limited version. However, the first
        standardized version, <big><b>HTML 2.0</b></big>, was published in 1995, laying the foundation for web
        development as we know it today</P>

    <h2 id="seven">Advantages of HTML</h2>
    <li>HTML is used to build websites.</li>
    <li>It is supported by all browsers.</li>
    <li>It can be integrated with other languages like CSS, JavaScript, etc.</li>
    <h2 id="eight">Disadvantages of HTML</h2>
    <li>HTML can only create static web pages. For dynamic web pages and logic, we need JavaScript.</li>
    <li>A large amount of code has to be written to create a simple web page.</li>
